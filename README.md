# DynamicEngine3D

**DynamicEngine3D** is a soft-body physics engine built using the XPBD (Extended Position-Based Dynamics) framework. It allows for the simulation of deformable objects in 3D space, offering realistic interactions and stable behavior for soft bodies in real-time applications. It is built specifically for Krumpl3D
